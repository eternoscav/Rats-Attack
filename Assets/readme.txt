Documentation About Resolutions
-Hi! 
 In Crusher Balloons Project everything its created with planes, from characters to buttons, so, the easiest way of creating several resolution is
 -Go to File-Build Settings-Resolution and Presentation and there just introduce the Height and Width of the resolution you want (This is on pc-mac, in Android and IOS, you will have them
 under free aspect in game tab. And then select the resolution on Game tab, under free aspect.
 -After that, the only thing you will have to do, is to adjust the position of the button.
 -When all the buttons are positioned, just save the scene as a new scene and call it with the resolution name, for example myProject800x480
 -The you will have to create a script very similar to LoadScene.cs where you will ask which resolution has the device, and which scene you will have to load.
 That its all.
 If you didnt understand something just email me.
 
 Cheers!
